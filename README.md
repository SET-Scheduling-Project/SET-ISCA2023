# SET-ISCA2023

The framework for the paper ***["Inter-layer Scheduling Space Definition and Exploration for Tiled Accelerators"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3579371.3589048)*** in ISCA 2023. If you utilize this tool for your academic work, we kindly request that you reference our paper and provide a citation for your work. For industry applications, we kindly request that you inform us via email. We warmly welcome potential collaborations in both academic and industrial domains, and we are committed to offering our best support.

We will continue updating the framework codes and annotations in the future.

The "Scheduling Space Size Calculation" and "Optimal HW-tile Allocation Algorithm" mentioned in the paper can be found in ***[this repo](https://github.com/SET-ISCA2023/Tile-Alloc-Algorithm)***. The same repo is cited in the paper.
