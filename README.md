The framework for the paper ***["Inter-layer Scheduling Space Definition and Exploration for Tiled Accelerators"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3579371.3589048)*** in ISCA 2023.

We will continue updating the framework codes and annotations in the future.

The "Scheduling Space Size Calculation" and "Optimal HW-tile Allocation Algorithm" mentioned in the paper can be found in ***[this repo](https://github.com/SET-ISCA2023/Tile-Alloc-Algorithm)***. The same repo is cited in the paper.
